# Design tokens — Figma ↔ code sync

This project keeps its **design-token values** in the Figma design system.
They flow into the app as a flat JSON file, applied as CSS custom properties
on `:root` at runtime — no CSS build step required to see a token change.

## Files

| File | Role | Edit by hand? |
|---|---|---|
| `design/figma-tokens.json` | Structured snapshot of the token values exported from Figma (colors, spacing, radius, grid, font sizes), grouped by collection with aliases. **Record of what Figma has.** | Only via re-export (see below) |
| `scripts/build-tokens.mjs` | Flattens the structured JSON → `src/styles/tokens/tokens.json`. | Yes (it's the transform) |
| `src/styles/tokens/tokens.json` | Flat `{ "css-name": "value" }` map, imported directly by `src/lib/applyTokens.ts` and set as CSS custom properties before the app renders. **This is what the app actually reads.** | Yes — for quick manual tweaks. Vite hot-reloads JSON imports, so edits show up immediately. A future `npm run tokens` run overwrites it from `design/figma-tokens.json`, so fold any tweak you want to keep back into that file too. |
| `src/lib/applyTokens.ts` | Runtime link: reads `tokens.json`, sets `--{name}` on `document.documentElement`. | Only if changing *how* tokens are applied, not their values |
| `src/styles/tokens/typography.css` | Font families + `--type-*` composition (uses `--size-*` from tokens.json). | Yes |
| `src/styles/tokens/shadows.css` | Shadow tokens (mirror of Figma effect styles). | Yes |
| `src/styles/tokens/fonts.css` | `@font-face` / webfont import. | Yes |

## Regenerate tokens.json from a fresh Figma export

```bash
npm run tokens
```

Reads `design/figma-tokens.json` and rewrites `src/styles/tokens/tokens.json`.

## The sync loop (design → code)

1. **Change token values in Figma** (e.g. recolor `blue/700`, change `space/5`).
   Every variable carries its CSS name as **code syntax** (`var(--blue-700)`),
   which is the contract between Figma and this repo.
2. **Re-export `design/figma-tokens.json`.** Two options:
   - **Plugin export (used to bootstrap this):** run the variables-export script
     against the Figma file via the Figma MCP / a small plugin, and paste the
     resulting JSON into `design/figma-tokens.json`.
   - **Figma REST API (recommended for automation):** `GET
     /v1/files/:key/variables/local` with a Figma personal access token, then
     map each variable's `codeSyntax.WEB` → CSS name and its mode value → CSS
     value. (Requires a paid Figma seat for the Variables REST endpoint.)
3. **Run `npm run tokens`** and commit the regenerated `tokens.json`.

Because the app applies these as the same CSS custom properties every
component already consumes (`var(--primary)`, …), the whole UI restyles
automatically — no component edits needed for pure retokens. For a quick
one-off tweak without touching Figma, you can also just hand-edit
`src/styles/tokens/tokens.json` directly.

## What is NOT auto-generated (on purpose)

- **Font families** (`--font-serif`, `--font-sans`) stay hand-authored in
  `typography.css` so the fallback stacks survive (Figma only stores the bare
  family name).
- **Shadows** live in `shadows.css` (mirror of Figma effect styles) — shadows
  can't be Figma *variables*.
- **Component structure & page layout** are not derived from Figma — those are
  implemented in React and verified visually per change. Only the *token layer*
  is deterministic.

## Adding a new token

Create the variable in Figma **first** (with WEB code syntax `var(--your-name)`),
re-export the JSON, then `npm run tokens`. Never add a token only in code — it
would be overwritten on the next regenerate.

## See also — the design canvas

[`design/canvas/`](./canvas/README.md) publishes the whole system as a browsable
canvas: the token layer above rendered as swatches and specimens, every
component with its real states, and the ten screens. It is a *view* of what
ships — its component sheets render a verbatim copy of `src/styles/app.css`, so
it cannot silently disagree with the app — and it is **not** part of the build.
Nothing there feeds back into Figma or into `tokens.json`; this file still
describes the only path token values travel.
